# Project Overview

## Goals
- Engineering mandate to improve overall quality.
- Provide quality gates at each stage of the development lifecycle, in this case at PR stage. 
- Centralize Security/Static Analysis.
- Provide comprehensive Code Coverage metrics.
- Identify Lines-of-Code (LoC) requirement for licensing and budget.
- Easy to use.

---
# Project Overview
## Initial Constraints
- Must be able to support large number of globally distributed engineers.
- Multi-language support. Scala, Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust.
- Must integrate with GitHub, Gradle, Buildkite, and Backstage Internal Developer Platform.
- PoC limited to one full-time engineer. (Me)
- Production environment must fulfill the "Production Readiness Review" requirements and get approval. ‚ö†Ô∏è _External dependency!_
- Product must pass internal security review. ‚ö†Ô∏è _External dependency!_ 

---
# Project Overview
## Buy vs Build
- Cheaper to buy. Core competencies on team and in company are elsewhere.
- SonarQube is widely used and understood.
- SonarQube Enterprise provided the features we needed.
- Security team was already interested in using SonarQube, easier to acquire budget.
- SonarQube Enterprise quickly scales to support the entire company.

---
# Project Overview
## Key Constraints Identified in PoC
- SonarCloud (SaaS) did not have feature parity with SonarQube Enterprise.
  - Limited configuration of scanning profiles.
  - No SAST support.
  - Limited reporting features.
- SonarQube Enterprise does not support HA.
- Needed to support ~5M LoC for the initial target repos.

# Architecture Overview
#### Infrastructure
![bg right height:80%](./marp/assets/sonarqube-infra.jpg)


<!-- _footer: "Diagram created using diagrams.net by Ryan Hass.\n Inspired by SonarQube, 'Reference Architecture for Developer Edition/Enterprise Edition (up to 10 M LOC)':\n https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/setup-and-upgrade/reference-architectures/up-to-10m-loc/ " -->

---
#### Terraform Build
HCL Broken into three modules:
  - CloudSQL Proxy (Not a true sidecar, really a separate deployment).
  - SonarQube Shared Infra and Config between environments.
  - SonarQube Helm Chart deployment. 

Dev/Test Environment:
  - Lint
  - Dry-Run

Production:
  - Merge to main triggers `apply` to production.

---
#### Buildkite Scanner Build
- Abstracted away configuration.
- Build on upstream image: `docker.io/sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli`
- Sends Slack notifications to monitoring channel when failures occurred. (Good SNR, but reactive.)
- Provided integration tests for SonarQube itself.
  - PR builds run only when changes to buildkite-scanner subdirectory.
  - Always built when merged to main.
- Made adoption easy!

#### Buildkite Scanner Container Usage
`.buildkite/pipeline.yaml`
```yaml
# Tests can have multiple steps for unit, functional, and integration tests..
- label: ":test_tube: Running Tests"
  key: "tests"
  command: "make test"
  artifact_paths:
    - "coverage.out"

- label: ":sonarqube: Continuous Code Inspection"
  env:
    VAULT_SONAR_TOKEN_PATH: "kv/example/my-token"
  agents:
    image: "example.registry.notreal/buildkite-scanner:latest"
  depends_on:
    - "tests"
  command:
  # Download the saved coverage report from the `tests` step.
    - "buildkite-agent download coverage.out"
  allow_dependency_failure: true
    retry:
      manual:
        allowed: true
```

# Retrospective
### What went well
- Backstage integration.
- Organic adoption and user growth.
- Addressed the quality gate requirement fairly well at PR stage.
- Coverage metrics improved over time.
- SAML Integration with Okta.
- Fixed a liveness check, and PR was accepted! https://github.com/SonarSource/helm-chart-sonarqube/pull/325

# Retrospective
<style scoped>
  section {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
### What didn't go well
- SonarQube bugs were common in non-LTS releases.
- Scala toolchain upgrade broke coverage reporting for Scala codebase.
- Go built-in reports are inaccurate, resulting in developer distrust of metrics. (No branch coverage.)
- Scanning Kibana.
- Okta Groups & GitHub Teams.
- User adoption of mitigation workflow.

### What would I do differently?
- Separate Dev/Test and Production CloudSQL instances.
  - Connection string is used for licensing.
  - Improve backup and restore as result.
- Use ArgoCD.
- Dev environment using Kind for local development. https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/
- Backstage to address Team/Group sync.
- Turn buildkite steps into plugin.
- Enable public access to Elastic SonarQube for specific OpenSource projects.
- Sync test environment after production release.
- Migrate to SaaS.

# What did I learn?
- Convention over Configuration.
  - Leveraging the Internal Developer Platform templating for new projects was key to adoption.
  - Lead by example.
- Ownership Hand-off.
- Depending on a vendor with a limited support contract is painful.
- May not be the right solution for everyone.
