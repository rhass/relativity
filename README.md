# Building

This project uses Flox to setup the environment. 

1. [Download and Install Flox](https://flox.dev/download/)
2. Once flox is installed, you can run `flox activate`.
3. Run `marp presentation.md` to generate the `presentation.html` file.

# Viewing the Presentation
There are two way to view the marp presentation.
1. Open the `presentation.html` file in a browser after building it. This is the recommended method to do an actual full-screen presentation.
2. Install the marp VSCode extension and open the `presentation.md` file. This will provide a realtime preview of your work.
