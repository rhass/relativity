# Building

This project uses Flox to setup a local environment. 

1. [Download and Install Flox](https://flox.dev/download/)
2. Once flox is installed, you can run `flox activate`.
3. Run `marp index.md` to generate the `index.html` file.


# Viewing the Presentation
There are a few ways to view the slides.
1. View the released version on https://rhass.github.io/relativity/
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser after building it. This is the recommended method to do an actual full-screen index.
3. Install the marp VSCode extension and open the `index.md` file. This will provide a realtime preview of your work.
4. Download the tarball generated by GitHub actions and open `index.html`


# Testing CI Changes

I have opted to use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to reduce some PR churn for CI changes. The easiest way to run `act` is from within the flox environment. It is however limited to the build phase, and cannot publish the results.

1. `flox activate`
2. `act`
